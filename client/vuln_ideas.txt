- innerHTML instead of innerText to allow XSS
 - simple xss 

 - send messages from the target through the XSS
 - perhaps upload files through XSS?
 - upload file to server, send target link, do something on click?
  - sending all messages?
 - expand on XSS with insecure private key
  - use xss to send exported private key
  - extractable true instead of false in rsa key gen function

- file upload
 - if file names not randomised, overwrite someone elses file
 - if file names are not randomised and use a small amount of values, can (maybe) crack random seed, find future values and therefore retrieve others' files
